    - I had some trouble setting up path finding as it works quite different in Godot 4. Once you've figured it out, it's actually much more straigt forward. Here is an article outlining what needs to be done: [Navigation Server for Godot 4.0](https://godotengine.org/article/navigation-server-godot-4-0). Also, big shoutout to [warriormaster](https://www.reddit.com/user/warriormaster/) on Reddit who patiently helped me debug this.
